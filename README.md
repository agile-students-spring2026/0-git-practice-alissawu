## [The Difficulty of Complexity](https://ethanniser.dev/blog/the-difficulty-of-complexity) by Ethan Niser

This is actually someone I know, but I really like this article because of how applicable it is to everything in being a SWE. The core idea is that there's a difference between something being _complex_ and something being _difficult_ — complexity is inherent and doesn't go away, but difficulty is temporary and fades once you actually learn the thing. As someone still building up my SWE skills, that distinction hits hard. It's easy to look at a new framework or concept and feel like it's impossibly hard, when really you just haven't put in the time yet. It's a good reminder that the learning curve is worth it, and that feeling uncomfortable with something new doesn't mean it's actually beyond you, it just means you're not fluent yet.

## Comment by Felix:

Yes, I think that once you get past the difficulty curve, you can not only start appreciating the inner workings of something more, but you can also start creating your own complexity in a way. Kind of like cooking where learning difficult techniques allows you to create elaborate dishes, and the only limiter is your creativity.
